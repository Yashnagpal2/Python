    "Here are some ways to achieve data abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of hiding the implementation details of data and operations in a class or module. This allows the user to interact with the data only through a set of predefined methods, which provides a high degree of abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information Hiding: Information hiding is a technique used to prevent the user from accessing the internal representation of the data. This can be achieved by using access modifiers in object-oriented programming languages, such as private and protected, to restrict access to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract Data Types (ADTs): ADTs are high-level data structures that define the data and the operations that can be performed on it. This provides a level of abstraction that hides the implementation details of the data structure, making it easier to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they are of the same class. This enables the user to work with a collection of objects in a generic way, without having to know the specific implementation details of each object.\n",
